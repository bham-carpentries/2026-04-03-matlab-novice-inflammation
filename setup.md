## MATLAB
You will need to install MATLAB or [GNU Octave][gnu-octave] to do this lesson.
Access MATLAB via [AppsAnywhere](https://apps.bham.ac.uk/) by launching MATLAB R2024a - (Core Application Only)
  
Or download via the [University of Birmingham Mathworks portal](https://uk.mathworks.com/academia/tah-portal/university-of-birmingham-40472096.html) (a Mathworks login will be needed)

MATLAB online is not suitable for this course.


## Course Data
You will also need to download some data, which we will analyze using MATLAB:

1. Download [matlab-novice-inflammation.zip](data/matlab-novice-inflammation.zip) and move the file to your Desktop.

2. Extract the zip archive. This will create a `matlab-novice-inflammation` directory containing the data files used in the lesson.
  Note that on Windows, double-clicking on the zip file simply previews the contents: to extract, right-click and select **Extract All**

3. You can access this folder from the Unix shell with:
  
  ```bash
  cd Desktop/matlab-novice-inflammation/
  ```
